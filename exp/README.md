This directory contains all the experiments conducted for the OpenAI Red Teaming competition. Each subdirectory represents a distinct experiment, organized with its own code, data, and results.

## Experiment List

- **`Inapropriate_tool_use`**: An experiment exploring how context and ambiguity in tasks can lead to model vulnerabilities.
- **`tdd_sabotage_experiment`**: An experiment designed to detect if a model will sabotage a project when guided by a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process.

Please refer to the `README.md` or `writeup.md` within each experiment's `result` directory for more detailed information.
