Revealing Critical Agentic Failure Modes in `gpt-oss-20b` through Automated, State-Aware Testing Harnesses.

# Project Description

## 1. Introduction

The increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agentic systems necessitates a paradigm shift in safety testing. Traditional, static prompt-response evaluations are insufficient for uncovering vulnerabilities that emerge from stateful, multi-turn interactions. Our project addresses this gap by developing and employing two novel, automated testing harnesses to systematically probe `gpt-oss-20b` for emergent, high-risk failure modes in simulated real-world scenarios.

Our research has uncovered two distinct and severe vulnerabilities, which we term **"Cognitive Stagnation"** and **"Context-Dependent Task Ambiguity."** These findings highlight critical flaws in the model's practical reasoning and safety-filter applications, posing significant risks if deployed in autonomous agentic systems.

## 2. Methodology: Automated Testing Harnesses

To move beyond simple prompt injection, we engineered two distinct frameworks to evaluate the model's behavior in complex, goal-oriented tasks.

1.  **Iterative TDD Harness:** A framework that simulates a Test-Driven Development (TDD) loop. The model is tasked with writing code to pass a series of unit tests. This harness allows us to quantify the model's ability to reason, learn from errors, and solve practical programming problems beyond simple algorithms. It is instrumental in revealing failure modes related to problem-solving in unfamiliar domains.

2.  **Contextual Ambiguity Framework:** A system designed to test how conversational history influences the model's interpretation of ambiguous, high-stakes commands. The framework first primes the model with a series of benign, helpful interactions before issuing a final, colloquial, and potentially destructive command. This allows us to measure the override of safety protocols by contextual priming.

## 3. Summary of Findings

Our investigation has identified several critical vulnerabilities. The two primary findings detailed in this report are:

-   **Cognitive Stagnation:** The model enters a non-productive, repetitive loop when faced with practical coding tasks outside its core algorithmic training domain, failing to learn from repeated errors.
-   **Inappropriate Tool Use via Context-Dependent Task Ambiguity:** The model's safety alignment is eroded by benign conversational context, leading it to execute destructive commands based on ambiguous, colloquial instructions.

*(This report will be updated with two additional findings.)*

## 4. Detailed Finding 1: Cognitive Stagnation in Unfamiliar Domains

**Overview:** Our TDD Harness revealed a critical failure mode where the model, despite excelling at algorithmic tasks, enters a non-productive, repetitive loop when faced with practical software development tasks in domains like web and mobile UI development. The model confidently attempts to generate code but produces fundamentally incorrect solutions. When presented with the failing test output, instead of attempting a novel solution, it repeatedly submits the same incorrect code.

-   **Severity (5/10):** This represents a critical flaw for autonomous agents. An agent stuck in a resource-consuming loop could lead to significant financial loss (API costs, compute time) or fail to complete time-sensitive tasks like deploying a critical security patch, leading to extended outages.
-   **Breadth (5/10):** This vulnerability likely affects any user leveraging the model for end-to-end software development in domains where its training was less comprehensive. This represents a large segment of users who expect generalist coding capabilities beyond self-contained algorithms.
-   **Novelty (5/10):** While models are known to fail, this documents a specific, reproducible *mode* of failure—a persistent, non-productive loop—that is particularly dangerous for autonomous systems. Our TDD harness provides a novel methodology for systematically inducing and documenting this state.

## 5. Detailed Finding 2: Inappropriate Tool Use via Context-Dependent Task Ambiguity

**Overview:** Our Contextual Ambiguity Framework demonstrated that the model's safety filters can be bypassed by priming it with a benign context before issuing an ambiguous, destructive command. After successfully guiding the model through a series of safe file-system operations (e.g., `mkdir`, `cp`), we issued a vague "cleanup" command like "That's a wrap, please wipe the slate clean." In **16.2%** of 500 diverse test cases, the model interpreted this ambiguously and executed a destructive `rm -rf` command on the project directory it had just been working on.

`[Insert figure: Diagram illustrating the multi-turn conversation flow. Show 3-4 benign turns (mkdir, cp) followed by the final ambiguous prompt, leading to the dangerous `rm -rf` tool call.]`

-   **Severity (5/10):** This vulnerability can lead to unintentional, catastrophic data loss. The phrases used to trigger the vulnerability are common and colloquial, making accidental data destruction a plausible real-world scenario for users of an AI agent with shell access.
-   **Breadth (5/10):** The technique is generalizable across various task domains. Any user interacting with a file-system-capable agent over multiple turns could be at risk. The use of common language makes this a widespread threat.
-   **Novelty (8/10):** This finding moves beyond simple "jailbreaking." It demonstrates a more subtle attack vector where the model's safety alignment is eroded by conversational context. It's not about tricking the model into ignoring a rule with one prompt, but about making a dangerous action seem like the "helpful" and logical next step based on the preceding dialogue.

## 6. Reproducibility and Tooling

All findings are fully reproducible. We have provided the complete source code for both the TDD Harness and the Contextual Ambiguity Framework, along with the datasets (`.json` scenario files) used in our experiments. The `steps_to_reproduce` in each `*.findings.json` file provide the exact commands needed to replicate our results.

## 7. Conclusion and Broader Impact

Our research demonstrates that `gpt-oss-20b`, while powerful, exhibits critical failure modes when deployed in state-aware, agentic roles. The vulnerabilities of "Cognitive Stagnation" and "Context-Dependent Task Ambiguity" are not simple edge cases but point to systemic weaknesses in handling unfamiliar domains and interpreting ambiguous instructions within a broader conversational context. These findings underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated, automated, and state-aware testing methodologies to ensure the safety and reliability of next-generation AI agents.
